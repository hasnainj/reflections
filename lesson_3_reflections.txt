When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

Remote repositories are used for collaboration between various 
contributors.
It also serves as an extra level of maturity where you release your work 
to public for consumption. You won't release a half baked 
immature version of a project on a public repository.
Keeping all our work local will also have a danger of losing it all if 
something happens to local machine.

Describe th edifferences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is a chain of changes occuring in a repository recorded by Git and it can be divided into further branches. Each branch can track the changes all the way to the beginning of the repository. Branches are usually used when the author wants to test a feature or a change to the master without affecting the master branch.

Clone is a duplicating of a branch of a repository. One can clone any branch of an available Git repository to his own system. Clones can be local to local or from remote to local. 

Fork is specifically related to GitHub repositories. It relates to the facility of cloning an existing GitHub repository to your own account on the GitHub. You wouild use fork when you want to clone an existing GitHub repository to make your own changes but at the same time you want to give recognition to original author of the repository. 

So, in a sentence, Fork is a clone of a branch of a GitHub repository from one GitHub account to another GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Testing local commit of this reflection with remote with git pull command.
