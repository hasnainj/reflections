When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories are used for collaboration between various contributors.
It also serves as an extra level of maturity where you release your work to public for consumption. You won't release a half baked 
immature version of a project on a public repository.
Keeping all our work local will also have a danger of losing it all if something happens to local machine.
