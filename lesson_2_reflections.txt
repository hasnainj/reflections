What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, Git makes the .git directory in that 
folder and sets it up to track the changes however, it doesn't track 
changes just yet. So, at initialized state repository is set up. We have 
to do the commits to the repository later on. Git doesn't do any commits 
during the initialization because firstly, we might not want to track 
all the files and secondly we won't have an opportunity to add our 
comments to the commit. We need to initialize the repository to create 
it and to let git know that we would like git to set it up for tracking 
changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

We can add files from working directory to staging area and change the files before committing them into the repository. We can have many untracked files in the working directory, in staging area we will only have tracked files and in the repository only committed files will be present. It gives us an opportunity to make sure that the commit we are about to make does indeed contains a logical commit and also it lets us commit only relevant file to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

We can use 'git diff' to compare the changes between staging area and 
working directory to see all changes we have made. Then we can add the 
files related to a logical change into the staging area. Then we can git 
diff --staged to compare changes with the last commit. This will ensure 
that we are only going to commit one logical change. Once we are sure we 
can git commit to commit that logical change.
